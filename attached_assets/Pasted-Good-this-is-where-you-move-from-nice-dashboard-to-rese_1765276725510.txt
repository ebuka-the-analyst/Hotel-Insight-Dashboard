Good, this is where you move from “nice dashboard” to **research-level hotel intelligence**.

You’ve already built in:

* Seasonality
* Weekend/weekday pattern
* Corporate vs leisure behaviour
* Cancellations & lead time
* Pricing logic

**Beyond that, here’s what else you can analyse at a PhD level** using just this dataset.

---

## 1. Property-level performance & positioning (Hyatt Place vs Hyatt House)

**Questions**

* How do the two properties differ in:

  * ADR (Average Daily Rate), RevPAR, Occupancy, LOS?
  * Cancellation rates by segment/channel?
  * Market mix (corporate vs leisure vs group vs long stay)?

**Analytical ideas**

* **Panel / multilevel models**: treat each property as a “group” and model Rate or Cancellation probability as:
  [
  \text{Rate}_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Month}_t + \beta_2 \text{Weekend}*t + \beta_3 \text{Segment}*i + u*{\text{Property}} + \epsilon*{it}
  ]
  to see how much variance is due to property vs time vs guest mix.

* **Positioning view**:

  * Scatter: x = ADR, y = Occupancy %, size = RevPAR, colour = Property.
  * This becomes an executive “who’s winning and why” visual for your web app.

## 2. Lead time curves & booking-window behaviour

**Questions**

* How far in advance do different segments and channels book?
* Where is the **risk window** for cancellations?

**Analytical ideas**

* **Booking-window distribution**:

  * Plot Lead Time histograms by:

    * Market Segment (Corporate vs Leisure vs Group vs Long Stay)
    * Channel (Direct vs OTA vs Agent vs GDS)

* **Hazard of cancellation vs lead time**:

  * Fit a **logistic regression** or **survival-style model**:
    [
    P(\text{Cancel}) = f(\text{LeadTime}, \text{Channel}, \text{DepositType}, \text{Segment})
    ]
  * Use this to define:

    * “Safe window” (e.g., bookings inside 7 days rarely cancel)
    * “Volatile window” (e.g., 30–90 days out with OTA + refundable)

* This feeds directly into a **“Cancellation Risk Heatmap”** on your dashboard (Lead Time vs Channel vs Segment).

---

## 3. Length-of-stay (LOS) optimisation & occupancy patterns

**Questions**

* Which segments and channels deliver the best **LOS × Rate** combination?
* Does Length of Stay impact cancellation or revenue per night?

**Analytical ideas**

* **LOS distribution** by segment:

  * Corporate: lots of 1–3 nights?
  * Long Stay/group: 7+ nights?

* **Revenue-per-stay vs LOS**:

  * Compare:

    * Short stays: high ADR but more cleaning/turnover.
    * Longer stays: lower ADR but lower operational churn (housekeeping & check-in/out load).

* **Survival analysis** on stay extension:

  * Define probability of **extended stays** (if you later add “extended nights” column).
  * In your app, you can surface:
    “Guests with LOS ≥ 5 and Corporate Segment have X% chance of requesting an extension.”

## 4. Channel performance & “cost of distribution” logic

Even if you don’t yet have real acquisition cost, you can **simulate or attach standard assumptions**.

**Questions**

* Which channels are **most profitable after assumed fees**?
* Which channels drive the most **cancellations, short stays, and imbalance in demand**?

**Analytical ideas**

* For each channel (Direct, OTA, Agent, GDS):

  * ADR
  * Occupancy contribution
  * Cancellation rate
  * LOS
* Attach hypothetical cost:

  * Direct: 0–5%
  * OTA: 15–20%
  * Agent: 10–15%
  * GDS: ~10%

Compute **Net Revenue = RoomRevenue × (1 – Fee%)**.

This gives you a **Channel Quality Index**, ranking channels by profitability, not just volume.

## 5. Price sensitivity & demand curves (micro “revenue management”)

**Questions**

* How does **demand vary with price** within a season?
* Are certain segments or channels more price sensitive?

**Analytical ideas**

* Within a given month and day-of-week bucket (e.g., July weekends):

  * Bin Rate (e.g., £80–100, £101–120, etc.).
  * Plot **Occupancy or Bookings vs Rate** to approximate a **local demand curve**.
* Use **regression**:
  [
  \text{Bookings}_{t} = f(\text{Rate}_t, \text{DayOfWeek}_t, \text{Season}_t, \text{EventFlag}_t)
  ]
* For PhD-level work:

  * Explore **elasticity** by segment:
    [
    \text{Elasticity} = \frac{%\Delta \text{Demand}}{%\Delta \text{Price}}
    ]
  * Show that, for example:

    * Corporate weekday demand is less price-sensitive.
    * Leisure weekend demand is more sensitive to promo prices.

## 6. Cancellation typologies & policy impact

You already built logic for cancellations – now analyse it deeply.

**Questions**

* What **types of cancellations** do we have (last-minute vs early, OTA vs direct)?
* How would a **policy change** (e.g., stricter refundable window) impact revenue?

**Analytical ideas**

* **Cluster analysis / typologies** of cancelled bookings:

  * Features: Lead Time, Channel, Deposit Type, Segment, LOS, Rate.
  * Use k-means or another clustering approach (conceptually) to classify:

    * “High-risk OTA leisure long-lead bookings”
    * “Low-risk corporate last-minute bookings”
* **Scenario simulation**:

  * If we change rule: “Non-refundable for stays with Lead Time < 3 days”
  * Estimate:

    * Reduction in cancellations
    * Potential loss in demand due to stricter conditions
    * Net revenue impact

This is PhD-level when framed as **policy evaluation** using simulation / causal reasoning.

## 7. Guest mix, geography & diversification risk

**Questions**

* How dependent is the hotel on a few guest countries or segments?
* What happens if **one market collapses** (e.g., travel restriction)?

**Analytical ideas**

* **Country mix index**:

  * Share of room nights by Guest Country.
  * Use **Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)** for concentration:
    [
    HHI = \sum s_i^2
    ]
    where ( s_i ) is the share of nights from country i.
  * High HHI = risky over-reliance; low HHI = diversified.

* Compare this by **Property** and **Season**:

  * Maybe Hyatt House has a more international long-stay mix; Hyatt Place more UK corporate weekday.

## 8. Repeat guests, loyalty & proto-CLV

Even without spend beyond “Rate × Nights”, you can treat stays as **episodes in a customer lifecycle.**

**Questions**

* How do repeat guests differ from first-timers?
* Do repeat guests:

  * Cancel less?
  * Pay similar or higher rates?
  * Prefer particular room/meal/segments?

**Analytical ideas**

* Mark each **Name** as:

  * First-time vs returning (using Is Repeated Guest + Previous Bookings Not Canceled).
* Compute:

  * Average ADR, LOS, Cancellation Rate for each group.
* Define a very simple **Customer Lifetime Value proxy**:
  [
  CLV_{\text{guest}} \approx \sum (\text{Rate} \times \text{Nights})
  ]
* PhD-level extension:

  * Use **cohort analysis** (by first arrival month/year) to track **retention** of guests over time.

## 9. Operational strain & service quality risk

You already have:

* Booking Changes
* Same Room Assigned
* Waiting List Days
* LOS, Arrivals, Departures per day

Use these as **proxies for operational stress**.

**Questions**

* On which days is the property operationally “stretched”?
* When are guests more likely to experience room moves, changes, or waiting lists?

**Analytical ideas**

* Build a **daily operations index**:

  * For each date, compute:

    * Arrivals, Departures, In-House guests
    * No. of booking changes
    * Number of guests with “Waiting List Days > 0”
    * % of repeated guests NOT getting same room (service disappointment proxy)
  * Combine into a composite **Operational Load Score**.

* Then correlate this Operational Load Score with:

  * Cancellation rate
  * Balance outstanding
  * Share of OTA bookings (which often complicate allocations)

In your web app, this becomes a **heatmap calendar**:

* Green = smooth days
* Red = operationally intense days where service risk is high.

## 10. Room assignment quality & upgrade strategy (if you extend later)

Even with the current columns, you can start the thinking.

**Questions**

* Where are we breaking “Same Room Assigned” expectations?
* Do repeat guests get better room types?

**Analytical ideas**

* For repeat guests:

  * Compare Room Type to Charge vs Room Type on subsequent stays.
  * Identify implicit “upgrade patterns” (e.g., they often get Suites on low-demand nights).

* Use this to design:

  * A rule-based or ML-driven **upgrade recommender**:

    * When occupancy < 70%, consider upgrading high-CLV or repeat guests to certain room types.

---

## 11. Multi-objective optimisation view (RevPAR ↔ Cancellations ↔ Operations)

PhD-level doesn’t just mean one model – it means acknowledging **trade-offs**.

Use your dataset to explore:

* **Revenue objective**: maximise RevPAR
* **Stability objective**: minimise cancellation volatility and last-minute changes
* **Operational objective**: smooth arrivals/departures to avoid spikes

You can demonstrate how:

* Pushing price too high:

  * Increases ADR but might reduce occupancy and increase cancellations in some segments.
* Over-reliance on OTAs:

  * Fills occupancy but increases cancellation risk and reduces net revenue.
* Relaxed refundable policy:

  * Can increase demand but raises volatility (bad for staffing and planning).

This can be framed formally as a **multi-objective optimisation problem**, even if you don’t solve it fully in code yet.

---

If you want, next I can:

* Take **one or two of these (e.g., Cancellation Risk + Channel Profitability)**
* And design **exact charts + metrics + layout** for your **web dashboard** (e.g., “GM View”, “Revenue Manager View”, “Operations View”) so it looks and feels like a PhD-grade hotel analytics product.
